Informally speaking, a \textit{reduction} is a way of converting one problem to another problem in such a way that a solution to the second problem can be used to solve the first problem.

\begin{theorem}[Halting Problem]
    The language 
    \begin{equation*}
        HALT_\text{TM} = \{\langle M, w\rangle\mid\text{$M$ is a TM halting on $w$}\}
    \end{equation*}
    is undecidable.
