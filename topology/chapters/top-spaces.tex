\begin{definition}[Topology, Topological Space]
    A topology on a set $X$ is a collection $\T$ of subsets of $X$ having the following properties:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\emptyset$ and $X$ are in $\T$ 
        \item The union of the elements of any subcollection of $\T$ is in $\T$ 
        \item The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of $\T$ is in $\T$
    \end{itemize}
    A set $X$ for which a topology $\T$ has been specified is called a \textit{topological space}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Open Set]
    Let $X$ be a topological space with associated topology $\T$. A subset $U$ of $X$ is said to be open if it is an element of $\T$.
\end{definition}
This immediately implies that both $\emptyset$ and $X$ are open. In fact, we shall see that they are also closed. The topology $\T$ of all subsets of $X$ is called the \textbf{discrete topology} while the topology $\T = \{\emptyset, X\}$ is called the \textbf{indiscrete topology} or the \textbf{trivial topology}.

\begin{definition}
    Let $X$ be a set and $\T, \T'$ be two topologies defined on $X$. If $\T'\supseteq\T$, we say that $\T'$ is \textit{finer} than $\T$. Further, if $\T'\subsetneq\T$, then $\T'$ is said to be \textit{strictly finer} than $\T$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Basis]
    If $X$ is a set, a \textit{basis} for a topology on $X$ is a collection $\B$ of subsets of $X$ (called \textit{basis elements}) such that 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For each $x\in X$, there is at least one basis element $B$ containing $x$
        \item If $x$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_1$ and $B_2$, then there is a basis element $B_3$ containing $x$ such that $B_3\subseteq B_1\cap B_2$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Generated Topology]
    Let $\B$ be a basis for a topology on $X$. The \textit{topology generated by} $\B$ is defined as follows: A subset $U$ of $X$ is said to be open in $X$ if for each $x\in U$, there is $B\in\B$ such that $x\in B\subseteq U$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    The collection $\T$ generated by a basis $\B$ is indeed a topology on $X$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Obviously $\emptyset, X\in\T$. Suppose $\{U_\alpha\}$ is a $J$ indexed collection of sets in $\T$. Let $U = \bigcup_{\alpha\in J}U_\alpha$. Then, for each $x\in U$, there is an $\alpha\in J$ such that $x\in U_\alpha$ and thus, there is $B\in\B$ such that $x\in B\subseteq U_\alpha\subseteq U$ and thus $U\in\T$. Let $U_1,U_2\in\T$ and $x\in U_1\cap U_2$. Then, there exist $B_1,B_2\in\B$ such that $x\in B_1\subseteq U_1$ and $x\in B_2\subseteq U_2$ and thus, $x\in B_1\cap B_2\subseteq U_1\cap U_2$. But, by definition, there exists $B_3\in\B$ such that $x\in B_3\subseteq B_1\cap B_2\subseteq U_1\cap U_2$ and consequently $U_1\cap U_2\in\T$. This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $X$ be a set and $\B$ be a basis for a topology $\T$ on $X$. Then $\T$ equals the collection of all unions of elements of $\B$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Trivially note that all elements of $\B$ must be in $\T$ and thus, their unions too. Conversely, let $U\in\T$, then for all $x\in U$, there is $B_x\in\B$ such that $x\in B_x\subseteq U$. It is not hard to see that $U = \bigcup_{x\in U}B_x$ and we have the desired conclusion.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $X$ be a topological space. Suppose $\mathcal{C}$ is a collection of open sets of $X$ such that for each open set $U$ of $X$ and each $x\in U$, there is an element $C$ of $\mathcal{C}$ such that $x\in C\subseteq U$. Then $\mathcal{C}$ is a basis for the topology of $X$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We first show that $\B$ is a basis. Since $X$ is an open set, for each $x\in X$, there is $C\in\mathcal{C}$ such that $x\in C$. Let $C_1,C_2\in\mathcal{C}$. Since both $C_1$ and $C_2$ are given to be open, so is their intersection. Thus, for each $x\in C_1\cap C_2$, there is $C\in\mathcal{C}$ such that $x\in C\subseteq C_1\cap C_2$. Therefore, $\B$ is a basis.

    Let $\T'$ be the topology generated by $\mathcal{C}$ and $\T$ be the topology associated with $X$. Let $U\in\T$, then for each $x\in U$, there is $C\in\mathcal{C}$ such that $x\in C\subseteq U$, and thus $U\in\T'$ by definition. Conversely, let $W\in\T'$. Since $W$ can be written as a union of a collection of sets in $\mathcal{C}$, all of which are open, $W$ must be open too and thus $W\in\T$. This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $\B$ and $\B'$ be bases for the topologies $\T$ and $\T'$, respectively, on $X$. Then, the following are equivalent:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\T'$ is finer than $\T$
        \item For each $x\in X$ and each basis element $B\in\B$ containing $x$, there is a basis element $B'\in\B'$ such that $x\in B'\subseteq B$
    \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $\T'$ is finer than $\T$. Then $B\in\T$ and thus $B\in\T'$. As a result, there is, by definition $B'\in\T'$ such that $x\in B'\subseteq B$.

    Conversely, let $U\in\T$. Since $\B$ generates $\T$, for each $x\in U$, there is an element $B\in\B$ such that $x\in B\subseteq U$. But due to the second condition, there is an element $B'\in\B'$ such that $x\in B'\subseteq U$, implying that $U$ is in the topology generated by $\B'$, that is $\T'$. This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Subbasis]
    A \textit{subbasis} $\S$ for a topology on $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ whose union equals $X$. The topology generated by the subbasis $\S$ is defined to be the collection $\T$ of all unions of finite intersections of elements of $S$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    The topology generated by $\S$ is indeed a topology.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    For this, it suffices to show that the set $\B$ of all finite intersections of elements of $S$ forms a basis. Since the union of all elements of $\S$ equals $X$, for each $x\in X$, there is $S\in\S$ such that $x\in S$ and note that $S$ must be an element of $\B$. Finally, since the intersection of any two elements of $\B$ can trivially be written as a finite intersection of elements of $\S$, it must be an element of $\B$ and we are done.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Order Topology]
    Let $X$ be a set with a simple order relation an dassume $X$ has more than one element. Let $\B$ be the collection of all sets of the following types: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item All open intervals $(a,b)$ in $X$
        \item All intervals of the form $[a_0,b)$ where $a_0$ is the smalest element (if any) of $X$ 
        \item All intervals of the form $(a,b_0]$ where $b_0$ is the largest element (if any) of $X$
    \end{enumerate}
    The collection $\B$ is a basis for a topology on $X$ which is called the \textit{order topology}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Product Topology]
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. The \textit{product topology} on $X\times Y$ is the topology having as basis the collection $\B$ of all sets of the form $U\times V$ where $U$ and $V$ are open sets in $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    The collection $\B$ is indeed a basis.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    The first condition is trivially satisfied since $X\times Y\in\B$. Suppose $x\in (U_1\times V_1)\cap(U_2\times V_2) = (U_1\cap U_2)\times(V_1\cap V_2) = U_3\times V_3$ for some open sets $U_3$ and $V_3$ in $X$ and $Y$ respectively. This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    If $\B$ is a basis for the topology of $X$ and $\mathcal{C}$ is a basis for the topology of $Y$, then the collection 
    \begin{equation*}
        \mathcal{D} = \{B\times C\mid B\in\B,~C\in\mathcal{C}\}
    \end{equation*}
    is a basis for the product topology on $X\times Y$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Let $W$ be an open set in $X\times Y$ and $(x,y)\in W$. Then, by definition, there is $B\in\B$ and $C\in\mathcal{C}$ such that $(x,y)\in B\times C\subseteq W$ and we are done due to a preceeding lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    Let $\pi_1:X\times Y\to X$ be defined by the equation $\pi_1(x,y) = x$ and let $\pi_2:X\times Y\to Y$ be defined by the equation $\pi_2(x,y) = y$. The maps $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are called the \textit{projections} of $X\times Y$ onto its first and second factors, respectively.
\end{definition}

Then, by definition if $U$ is an open subset of $X$, then $\pi_1^{-1}(U) = U\times Y$ and similarly, if $V$ is an open subset of $Y$, then $\pi_2^{-1}(V) = X\times V$.

\begin{proposition}
    The collection 
    \begin{equation*}
        \S = \{\pi_1^{-1}(U)\mid \text{$U$ is open in $X$}\}\cup\{\pi_2^{-1}(V)\mid\text{$V$ is open in $Y$}\}
    \end{equation*}
    is a subbasis for the product topology on $X\times Y$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Since $X\times Y\in\S$, the union of all elements of $\S$ is $X\times Y$ and thus $\S$ is a subbasis. Let $\B$ be the basis generated by all finite intersections of $S$. It suffices to show that $\B = \{U\times V\mid\text{$U$ is open in $X$ and $V$ is open in $Y$}\}$. For any $U$ and $V$ open in $X$ and $Y$ respectively, we may write $U\times V = (U\times Y)\cap(X\times V)$ and is therefore a member of $\B$. Conversely, the finite intersection of elements of $S$ is of the form $(U_1\cap\ldots\cap U_m)\times(V_1\cap\ldots\cap V_m)$, which is a product of two open sets and is an element of $\B$, which finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    Let $X$ be a topological space with topology $\T$. If $Y$ is a subset of $X$, the collection 
    \begin{equation*}
        \T_Y = \{Y\cap U\mid U\in\T\}
    \end{equation*}
    is a topology on $Y$, called the \textit{subspace topology}. With this topology, the topological space $Y$ is called a \textit{subspace} of $X$. Its open sets consist of all intersections of open sets of $X$ with $Y$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    $\T_Y$ is a topology on $Y$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Since $\emptyset\in\T$, $\emptyset = Y\cap\emptyset\in\T_Y$ and since $X\in\T$, $Y = Y\cap X\in\T_Y$. Further, 
    \begin{equation*}
        \bigcup_{\alpha\in J}(U_\alpha\cap Y) = Y\cap\bigcup_{\alpha\in J}U_\alpha\in\T_Y
    \end{equation*}
    And finally, $(Y\cap U_1)\cap(Y\cap U_2) = Y\cap(U_1\cap U_2)\in\T_Y$. This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    If $\B$ is a basis for the topology of $X$ and $Y\subseteq X$. Then the collection 
    \begin{equation*}
        \B_Y = \{B\cap Y\mid B\in\B\}
    \end{equation*}
    is a basis for the subspace topology on $Y$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $V$ be an open set in $Y$. Then, there is $U$ in $X$ such that $V = U\cap Y$. Since each $x\in V$ is an element of $U$, there is, by definition $B\in\B$ such that $x\in B\subseteq U$, consequently, $x\in B\cap Y\subseteq V$ and we are done due to a preceeding lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. If $U$ is open in $Y$ and $Y$ is open in $X$, then $U$ is open in $X$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Follows from the fact that $U = V\cap Y$ for some $V$ that is open in $X$.
\end{proof}

\section{Closed Sets and Limit Points}
\begin{definition}[Closed Set]
    A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be \textit{closed} if the set $X\backslash A$ is open.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $X$ be a topological space. Then the following conditions hold:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\emptyset$ and $X$ are closed 
        \item Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed 
        \item Finite unions of closed sets are closed
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    All follow from De Morgan's laws.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. Then a set $A$ is closed in $Y$ if and only if it equals the intersection of a closed set of $X$ with $Y$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    If $A$ is closed in $Y$ then $Y\backslash A$ is open and thus, there is an open set $B$ in $X$ such that $Y\backslash A = Y\cap B$. Then,
    \begin{equation*}
        A = Y\backslash(Y\cap B) = Y\cap(X\backslash B)
    \end{equation*}
    which finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. If $A$ is closed in $Y$ and $Y$ is closed in $X$, then $A$ is closed in $X$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    Trivial.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Interior, Closure]
    Let $X$ be a topological space and $A\subseteq X$. The \textit{interior} of $A$ is defined as the union of all open sets contained in $A$ and the \textit{closure} of $A$ is defined as the intersection of all closed sets containing $A$. The interior of $A$ is denoted by $\Int A$ and the closure of $A$ is denoted by $\overline{A}$.
\end{definition}

Then, by definition, we have that 
\begin{equation*}
    \Int A\subseteq A\subseteq\overline{A}
\end{equation*}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$ and $A$ be a subset of $Y$. Let $\overline{A}$ denote the closure of $A$ in $X$. Then, the closure of $A$ in $Y$ is given by $\overline{A}\cap Y$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the collection of all closed sets in $X$ containing $A$. Then, by a preceeding theorem, we know that the set of all closed sets in $Y$ containing $A$ is given by $Y\cap\mathcal{F}$. And thus, 
    \begin{equation*}
        \bigcup_{C\in Y\cap\mathcal{F}} C = Y\cap\bigcup_{C\in\mathcal{F}}C = Y\cap\overline{A}
    \end{equation*}
    This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $A$ be a subset of the topological space $X$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Then $x\in\overline{A}$ if and only if every open set $U$ containing $x$ intersects $A$ 
        \item Supposing the topology of $X$ is given by a basis, then $x\in\overline{A}$ if and only if every basis element $B$ containing $x$ intersects $A$
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \hfill 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Suppose $x\in\overline{A}$ and $U$ be an open set containing $x$. Suppose for the sake of contradiction, there is an open set $U$ in $X$ that contains $x$ but does not intersect $A$, in which case $X\backslash U$ is a closed set containing $A$ and not containing $x$. By definition, since $\overline{A}\subseteq X\backslash U$, $x$ may not be an element of $\overline{A}$, a contradiction. Conversely, suppose every open set $U$ containing $x$ intersects $A$ and that $x\notin\overline{A}$. But then, the set $X\backslash\overline{A}$ is open and contains $x$ but does not intersect $A$, a contradiction.
        \item Suppose $x\in\overline{A}$, then every open set containing $x$ intersects $A$. Since all elements of $\B$ are open, they intersect $A$. Conversely, since every open set $U$ containing $x$ has a basis subset $B$ that contains $x$ and therefore intersects $A$, $U$ must intersect $A$. This finishes the proof.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

The stetement ``$U$ is an open set containing $x$'' is often shortened to ``$U$ is a \textbf{neighborhood} of $x$''.

\begin{definition}
    If $A$ is a subset of the topological space $X$ and if $x\in X$, we say that $x$ is a \textit{limit point} or \textit{cluster point} or \textit{accumulation point} of $A$ if every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$ in some point other than $x$ itself.
\end{definition}
For example every element of $\R$ is a limit point of $\Q$.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $A$ be a subset of the topological space $X$ and let $A'$ be the set of all limit points of $A$. Then 
    \begin{equation*}
        \overline{A} = A\cup A'
    \end{equation*}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    If $x\in A'$, due to the preceeding theorem, $x\in\overline{A}$ but since by definition, $A\subseteq\overline{A}$, we have that $A\cup A'\subseteq\overline{A}$.

    Conversely let $x\in\overline{A}$. If $x\in A$, we are done. If not, then $x$ is such that every open set containing $x$ intersects $A$. But since $x\notin A$, the intersection must contain at least one point distinct from $x$, implying that $x\in A'$. This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
    A subset of a topological space is closed if and only if it contains all its limit points.
\end{corollary}

\begin{definition}[Hausdorff Spaces]
    A topological space $X$ is called a \textit{Hausdorff space} if for each pair $x_1$ and $x_2$ of distinct points of $X$, there exist neighborhoods $U_1$ and $U_2$ of $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively that are disjoint.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Every finite point set in a Hausdorff space $X$ is closed.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    It suffices to show this for a single point set, say $\{x_0\}$. For any $x\in X$ different from $x_0$, there are open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x_0\in U$ and $x\in V$ and $U\cap V=\emptyset$. And thus, $x$ may not be in the closure of $\{x_0\}$. This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

The condition that finite point sets be closed has been given its own name, the \textbf{$T_1$ axiom}.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $X$ be a space satisfying the $T_1$ axiom and $A\subseteq X$. Then the point $x$ is a limit point of $A$ if and only if every neighborhood of $x$ contains infinitely many points of $A$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    If every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$ at infinitely many points, then it intersects it in at least one point other than $x$ and thus $x\in A'$.
    
    Conversely, suppose $x$ is a limit point of $x$ but there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ that intersecs $A$ in only finitely many points. Let $U\cap(A\backslash\{x\}) = \{x_1,\ldots,x_m\}$. Then, the open set $U\cap(X\backslash\{x_1,\ldots,x_m\})$ contains $x$ but does not intersect $A$, which is contradictory to the fact that $x$ is a limit point of $A$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    If $X$ is a Hausdorff space, then a sequence of points of $X$ convertes to at most one point of $X$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose the sequence $\{x_n\}$ converges to two distinct points $x$ and $y$. Then, by definition, there exist disjoint neighborhoods $U$ and $V$ of $x$ and $y$ respectively. Since $x_n$ converges to $x$, $U$ contains all but finitely many elements of the sequence but that means $V$ cannot, a contradiction.
\end{proof}


\section{Continuous Functions}
\begin{definition}
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. A function $f:X\to Y$ is said to be continuous if for each open subset $V$ of $Y$, the set $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces; let $f:X\to Y$. Then the following are equivalent 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $f$ is continuous 
        \item for every subset $A$ of $X$, one has $f(\overline{A})\subseteq\overline{f(A)}$ 
        \item for every closed set $B$ of $Y$, the set $f^{-1}(B)$ is closed in $X$ 
        \item for each $x\in X$ and each neighborhood $V$ of $f(x)$, there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $f(U)\subseteq V$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    $(1)\Rightarrow(2)$. Let $x\in\overline{A}$ and $V$ be an open set containing $f(x)$. We know by definition that $f^{-1}(V)$ is open and therefore intersects $A$. As a consequence, $V$ intersects $f(A)$, implying that $f(x)\in\overline{f(A)}$.

    $(2)\Rightarrow(3)$. Let $A = f^{-1}(B)$. Let $x\in\overline{A}$. Then, 
    \begin{equation*}
        f(x)\in f(\overline{A})\subseteq\overline{f(A)}\subseteq\overline{B} = B
    \end{equation*}
    and thus $x\in f^{-1}(B) = A$, implying that $A\subseteq\overline{A}\subseteq A$, finishing the proof.

    $(3)\Rightarrow(1)$. Let $V$ be an open set in $Y$ and let $U = f^{-1}(V)$. Since $Y\backslash V$ is closed, so is $f^{-1}(Y\backslash V) = f^{-1}(Y)\backslash U = X\backslash U$. Then, by definition, $U$ must be open.

    $(1)\Leftrightarrow(4)$. The forward direction is trivial. Conversely, let $V$ be an open set in $Y$ and $U = f^{-1}(V)$. For each $x\in U$, there is an open set $U_x$ such that $U_x\subseteq U$. Then, $U = \bigcup_{x\in U}U_x$ is open. This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Homeomorphism]
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces; let $f:X\to Y$ be a bijection. If both the function $f$ and the inverse function $f^{-1}:Y\to X$ are continuous, then $f$ is a \textit{homeomorphism}.
\end{definition}

As a result, any property of $X$ that is entirely expressed in terms of the topology of $X$ yields, via the correspondence $f$, the corresponding property for the space $Y$. Such a property of $X$ is called a \textbf{topological property}.

If $f:X\to Y$ is an injective, continuous map, where $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces. Let $Z$ be the image set $f(X)$, considered as a subspace of $Y$; then the function $f':X\to Z$ obtained by restricting the range of $f$ is bijective. If $f'$ happens to be a homeomorphism of $X$ with $Z$, we say that the map $f:X\to Y$ is a \textbf{topological imbedding} or simply an \textbf{imbedding} of $X$ in $Y$.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ be topological spaces 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item (Constant) If $f:X\to Y$ maps all of $X$ to a single point of $Y$, then it is continuous 
        \item (Inclusion) If $A$ is a subspace of $X$, the inclusion function $j:A\to X$ is continuous 
        \item (Composites) If $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ are ocontinuous, then the map $g\circ f: X\to Z$ is continuous
        \item (Domain Restriction) If $f:X\to Y$ is continuous, and if $A$ is a subspace of $X$, then the restricted function $f|_A:A\to Y$ is continuous.
        \item (Range Restriction/Expansion) Let $f:X\to Y$ be continuous. If $Z$ is a subspace of $Y$ containing the image set $f(X)$, then the function $g:X\to Z$ obtained by restricting the range of $f$ is continuous. If $Z$ is a space having $Y$ ias a subspace, then the function $h:X\to Z$ obtained by expanding the range of $f$ is continuous.
        \item (Local formulation of continuity) The map $f:X\to Y$ is continuous if $X$ can be written as the union of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}$ such that $f|_{U_\alpha}$ is continuous for each $\alpha$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

        \item Let $V$ be an open set in $Z$. Then, $g^{-1}(V)$ is open in $Y$ and $f^{-1}\circ g^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$ and thus $g\circ f$ is continuous
        \item Notice that $f|_A\equiv f\circ j$
        \item Let $V$ be an open set in $Z$. Then, there is an open set $W$ in $Y$ such that $V = Z\cap W$. Since the range of $f$ is a subset of $Z$, we have
        \begin{equation*}
            g^{-1}(V) = g^{-1}(Z\cap W) = f^{-1}(Z\cap W) = f^{-1}(W)
        \end{equation*}
        which is open in $X$ and thus, $g$ is continuous. A similar argument can be applied in the second case.
        \item Let $V$ be an open set in $Y$, then we may write 
        \begin{equation*}
            f^{-1}(V) = \bigcup_{\alpha}f|_{U_\alpha}^{-1}(V\cup U_\alpha)
        \end{equation*}
        which is a union of a collection of open sets and is therefore open. This finishes the proof.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Pasting Lemma]
    Let $X = A\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are closed in $X$. Let $f:A\to Y$ and $g:B\to Y$ be continuous If $f(x) = g(x)$ for every $x\in A\cap B$ then $f$ and $g$ combine to give a continuous function $h:X\to Y$ defined as 
    \begin{equation*}
        h(x) =
        \begin{cases}
            f(x) & x\in A\\
            g(x) & x\in B
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $C$ be a closed subset of $Y$. We then have $h^{-1}(C) = f^{-1}(C)\cup g^{-1}(C)$. Since $f$ is continuous, we know that $f^{-1}(C)$ is closed in $A$ and therefore in $X$ similarly, so is $g^{-1}(C)$, which finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $f:A\to X\times Y$ be given by the equation $f(a) = (f_1(a), f_2(a))$ then $f$ is continuous if and only if the functions $f_1:A\to X$ and $f_2:A\to Y$ are continuous. The maps $f_1$ and $f_2$ are called the \textit{coordinate maps} of $f$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We know that the projection maps $\pi_1, \pi_2$ are continuous. We note that $f_1(a) = \pi_1(f(a))$ and $f_2(a) = \pi_2(f_2(a))$. If $f$ is continuous, then so are $f_1$ and $f_2$.

    Conversely, suppose $f_1$ and $f_2$ are continuous and $U\times V$ be a basis element for the product topology on $X\times Y$. We know due to a preceeding result that both $U$ and $V$ are open in $X$ and $Y$ respectively. Then 
    \begin{equation*}
        f^{-1}(U\times V) = f_1^{-1}(U)\cap f_2^{-1}(V)
    \end{equation*}
    which is an intersection of two open sets and is therefore open.
\end{proof}

\section{Metric Topology}
\begin{definition}[Metric]
    A \textit{metric} on a set $X$ is a function $d:X\times X\to\R$ such that 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $d(x,y)\ge0$ for all $x,y\in X$; equality holds if and only if $x = y$
        \item $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ for all $x,y\in X$ 
        \item (Triangle Inequality) $d(x, y) + d(y, z)\ge d(x, z)$ for all $x,y,z\in X$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

For $\epsilon > 0$, define the set 
\begin{equation*}
    B_d(x,\epsilon) = \{y\mid d(x,y) < \epsilon\}
\end{equation*}

\begin{definition}[Metric Topology]
    If $d$ is a metric on the set $X$, then the collection of all $\epsilon$-balls $B_d(x,\epsilon)$ for $x\in X$ and $\epsilon > 0$ is a basis for a topology on $X$, called the \textit{metric topology} induced by $d$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    The collection of all $\epsilon$-balls $B_d(x,\epsilon)$ for all $x\in X$ and $\epsilon > 0$ is a basis.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    The first condition is trivially satisfied. Suppose $z\in B(x,\e)\cap B(y,\e)$. Let $r = \frac{1}{2}\min\{\e - d(x,z), \e - d(y,z)\}$. It is obvious, due to the triangle inequality, that $B(z,r)\subseteq B(x,\e)\cap B(y,\e)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Metrizable]
    If $X$ is a topological space, $X$ is said to be \textit{metrizable} if there exists a metric $d$ on the set $X$ that induces the topology of $X$.
\end{definition}

A \textbf{metric space} is a metrizable space $X$ together with a specific metric $d$ that gives the topology of $X$.

\begin{definition}
    Let $X$ be a metric space with metric $d$. A subset $A$ of $X$ is said to be \textit{bounded} if there is some number $M$ such that $d(a_1,a_2)\le M$ for every pair $a_1,a_2$ of points of $A$. if $A$ is bounded and non-empty, the \textit{diameter} of $A$ is defined to be 
    \begin{equation*}
        \diam(A) = \sup\{d(a_1,a_2)\mid a_1,a_2\in A\}
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    Every metric space is Hausdorff.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Trivial.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $X$ be a metric space with metric $d$. Define $\overline{d}:X\times X\to\R$ by the equation 
    \begin{equation*}
        \overline{d}(x,y) = \min\{d(x,y), 1\}
    \end{equation*}
    Then $\overline{d}$ is a metric that induces the same topology as $d$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We need only check the triangle inequality. This is euqivalent to 
    \begin{equation*}
        \overline{d}(x,y) + \overline{d}(y,z)\ge \overline{d}(x,z)
    \end{equation*}
    Obviously if either one of $\overline{d}(x,y)$ or $\overline{d}(y,z)$ is greater than or equal to $1$, then we are done. If not, then 
    \begin{equation*}
        \overline{d}(x,y) + \overline{d}(y,z) = d(x,y) + d(y,z)\ge\overline{d}(x,z)\ge\min\{d(x,z), 1\}
    \end{equation*}

    Let $\T$ be the topology on $X$ induced by $d$, having basis $\B$. Let $\overline{\B}$ be the set of all balls induced by $\overline{d}$ having radius strictly less than $1$. Let $U$ be an open set in $\T$ and $x\in U$, then, by definition, there is $B_d(x,\e)$ in $\B$ such that $x\in B_d(x,\e)\subseteq U$. The ball $B_{\overline{d}}(x,\frac{1}{2}\min\{\e, 1\})$ is contained in $B_d(x,\e)$ and also contains $x$. Thus, $\overline{\B}$ is a basis for $\T$. This finishes the proof.
\end{proof}
