\begin{definition}
    A topological space $X$ is said to have a \textit{countable basis at $x$} if there is a countable collection $\B$ of neighborhoods of $x$ such that each neighborhood of $x$ contains at least one o the elements of $\B$. A space that has a countable basis at each of its points is said to satisfy the \textit{first countability axiom} or to be \textit{first-countable}.
\end{definition}

Obviously, every metrizable space satisfies this axiom.

\begin{definition}
    If a space $X$ has a countable basis for its topology, then $X$ is said to satisfy the \textit{second countability axiom} or to be \textit{second-countable}
\end{definition}

From the definition of the topology generated by a basis, \textit{second countability} implies \textit{first countability}. Further, not every metric space is \textit{second-countable}. To see this, consider the following lemma:
\begin{lemma}
    Let $X$ be a topological space with a countable basis $\B$, then any discrete subspace $A$ of $X$ must be countable.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    The proof follows quite naturally. Since $A$ is discrete, for each $a\in A$, there is $B_a\in\B$ such that $B_a\cap A = \{a\}$. Then, the function $f:A\to\B$ given by $f(a) = B_a$ is an injection and thus $A$ is countable.
\end{proof}

Now, consider $\R^\omega$ with the uniform topology. The set $A = \{0,1\}^\omega$ is uncountable and under the uniform topology, is discrete, since $\overline{\rho}(a,b) = 1$ for all $a,b\in A$ with $a\ne b$. This immediately implies that $\R^\omega$ under the uniform topology may not have a countable basis and cannot be second-countable.

We now show that the same isn't true for $\R^\omega$ equipped with the product topology. It is well known that the countable collection of all open intervals $(a,b)$ with both $a,b\in\Q$ forms a basis for $\R$. Then, $\R^\omega$ has a \textbf{countable basis} of all open sets of the form $\prod_{n\in\Z^+}U_n$ where $U_n$ is an open interval with rational end points for finitely many values of $n$ and $U_n = \R$ for all others.
