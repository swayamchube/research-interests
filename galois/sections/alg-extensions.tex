\begin{definition}[Extension, Degree]
    Let $F$ be a field. If $F$ is a subfield of another field $E$, then $E$ is said to be an \textit{extension} field of $F$. The dimension of $E$ when viewed as a vector space over $F$ is said to be the \textit{degree of the extension} $E/F$ and is denoted by $[E:F]$.

\begin{definition}[Distinguished Class]
    Let $\mathscr{C}$ be a class of extension fields $F\subseteq E$. We say that $\mathscr{C}$ is distinguished if it satisfies the following conditions: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $k\subseteq F\subseteq E$ be a tower of fields. The extension $K\subseteq E$ is in $\mathscr{C}$ if and only if $k\subseteq F$ is in $\mathscr{C}$ and $F\subseteq E$ is in $\mathscr{C}$.

        \item If $k\subseteq E$ is in $\mathscr{C}$, if $F$ is any extension of $k$, and $E$, $F$ are both contained in some field, then $F\subseteq EF$ is in $\mathscr{C}$.

        \item If $k\subseteq F$ and $k\subseteq E$ are in $\mathscr{C}$ and $F$, $E$ are subfields of a common field, then $k\subseteq FE$ is in $\mathscr{C}$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\thlabel{lem:self-embedding-is-automorphism}
    Let $E/k$ be algebraic and let $\sigma: E\to E$ be an embedding of $E$ over $k$. Then $\sigma$ is an automorphism.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Since $\sigma$ is known to be injective, it suffices to show that it is surjective. Pick some $\alpha\in E$ and let $p(x)\in k[x]$ be its minimal polynomial over $k$. Let $K$ be the subfield of $E$ generated by all the roots of $p$ in $E$. Obviously, $[K:k]$ is finite. Since $p$ remains unchanged under $\sigma$, it is not hard to see that $\sigma$ maps a root of $p$ in $E$ to another root of $p$ in $E$. Therefore, $\sigma(K)\subseteq K$. But since $[\sigma(K):k] = [K:k]$ due to obvious reasons, we must have that $\sigma(K) = K$, consequently, $\alpha\in K = \sigma(K)$. This shows surjectivity.
\end{proof}
