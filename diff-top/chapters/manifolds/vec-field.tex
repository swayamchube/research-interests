\begin{definition}[Vector Field]
    Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. A \emph{vector field on $M$} is a continuous section $X:M\to TM$ of the map $\pi: TM\onto M$. 

    A vector field is said to be \emph{smooth} if the section $X: M\to TM$ is a smooth map of manifolds. A \emph{rough} vector field is simply a section $X: M\to TM$ which need not be continuous. The value of a vector field at a point is denoted by either $X(p)$ or $X_p$.

    The support of $X$ is defined to be 
    \begin{equation*}
        \Supp X = \overline{\{p\in M\mid X_p\ne 0\}}.
    \end{equation*}
    A vector field is said to be \emph{compactly supported} if $\Supp X\subseteq M$ is compact.
